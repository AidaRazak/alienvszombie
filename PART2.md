Problems Encountered & Solutions

#Problems
1. Saving game was not working at first.
2. We did not manage to move character a as per requirement. The character moves in one space only.
3. We had a hard time figuring out why we cannot move the character A to the positions we want in the board. 
4. We had trouble linking zombie attributes to the board.


#Solutions
1. We decided to troubleshoot again and analyse the function save game thoroughly and then eventually able to make the function works.
2. This is the biggest problem we had throughout our code. We have tried our best to move character a as per requirement but unfortunately we can't make it. we can just simply copy it from internet or from our friends but we chose to stay honest and be true to ourselves. it was quite a challenge for us not to complete the movements but we believe we made the right step. eventhough so, we succesfully coded in-advanced the supposed-to-be step by step and explanations for every move. we might miss a step but we have scribbled the rest of the way. 
3. Firstly, we try a lot of working codes however still having the problem to get the output that we wanted to. However, after few tries we get the output that we want but not satisfied enough. 
4. For first time output, we manage to link the zombie attributes to the board.

## Problems Encountered & Solutions
Problems:
1. Inability to execute command to set number of zombies in the board.
2. Problem to execute command on direction of Alien.
3. Centralizes the position of Alien.
4. Limits character that are about to be printed on board.
5. Inability to print board with the intended border and character.
6. Inability to set customizable board.
7. Inability to move Alien in particular direction.
8. Error to print output in accordance to desired flow.
9. Inability to print output from game controls.

Solutions:
1. We are still figuring out the solution to this problem. We have tried to fix this problem however, we still cannot execute the command as desired. We plan to look further into this and make changes again later.
2. This is by far the hardest command to be executed as for few times trying, the code could not be read. However, after we tried to change the whole code of that function, it works well just to move the Alien but still need to have some improvement.
3. We had a hard time figuring out how to centralises the position of Alien. After making some changes, we finally able to centralise it.
4. At first, the board prints the character on the board by filling all the spaces. We made some changes on the code and able to make the board prints the characters we needed with some empty spaces.
5. At first, the board does not print the border and characters like what we desired. We then take a look closer to the code and able to replace some codes to make the board runs as intended.
6. We were not able to set customizable board at the beginning. We then debug the code to see why we could not make it and at last, we are able to set the customizable board.
7. After being able to set the position of Alien, we had difficulties in moving the Alien to any particular direction. We tried to adjust the codes for some time and finally we were able to execute the command.
8. After we insert the code for game controls, we faced difficulties in executing the command in accordance. We tried to make changes in the arangement of the codes and able to execute the code in order later on.
9. We tried to print output from game controls after we finished inserting all the necessary commands. However, the commands cannot be read. We were able to run the code after we tried to make changes on the code and make a new function to store the commands.
